# HTML Fun DVD Screensaver
An HTML project I made for fun.
If you have luck, it might hit the corner.
I also have it on my [Webpage](https://craxelgaming2100.neocities.org/fun/dvdtext).
You can see the code [here](https://github.com/Craxelgaming2100/HTMLFunDVDScreensaver/blob/main/dvd.html).
### Custom Favicons
If you want to see how to change the favicon, go [here](FAVICON.md#adding-favicons).
If you want to credit the creator of the favicon you're using, read [this](FAVICON.md#crediting) section on [FAVICON.md](FAVICON.md).
