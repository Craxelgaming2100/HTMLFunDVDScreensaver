# Favicon
## Introduction
The favicon is the icon that appears on the page.
## Adding favicons
To add a favicon, do this:
```
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/images/favicon.ico">
```
You can use my favicon, which is located at https://craxelgaming2100.neocities.org/data/img/favicon.ico. [^1]
To change to that favicon, replace the example link with the link of that favicon.

# Notes
[^1]: The favicon link displays this:
  ![My favicon.](https://craxelgaming2100.neocities.org/data/img/favicon.png)
